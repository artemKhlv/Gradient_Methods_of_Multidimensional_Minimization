# Gradient_Methods_of_Multidimensional_Minimization
Gradient methods of multidimensional minimization for solving problems of multidimensional minimization by gradient methods and second-order methods.

## Task:
It is required to find the absolute minimum of a function of many variables y = f(x1, . . . , xn), that is, a point x ∈ Rn such that f(x) = min f(x).
